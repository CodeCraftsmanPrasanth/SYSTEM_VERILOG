# SYSTEM_VERILOG

This repository contains SystemVerilog source code and example designs that I practiced during my training period. It includes implementations of combinational circuits, sequential logic, FSMs, memory elements, OOP concepts, and verification testbenches covering fundamental to advanced digital design topics.
